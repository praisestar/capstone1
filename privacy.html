		<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small"> - Capstone and RED5 are trading names of Capstone LTD, who acts as the data controller. That means we’re responsible for all of the information you share with us when shopping on our site.</p><ul style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">

 <li>We never sell your data onto third parties, and only collect as much as we need to improve your experience, communicate with you or deliver your orders.</li>
 <li>We make every effort to protect your information, and won’t store it for longer than we need to.</li>
 <li>You are in control of any marketing messages we send you. You will always be able to opt out, and we will periodically check that you still want to hear from us. These marketing messages are treated separately to other emails we have to send you, such as order confirmations, shipping updates, feedback requests after your order or customer service messages.</li></ul>
 

<h3>Website Security</h3>  
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small"> The Capstone site combines AWS Network protection, IN4.0 AWS server expertise and 3rd party development agency to ensure the website is as secure as possible.</p>

		<h3>Payment Security  </h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">When shopping on our website, you may be redirected at the checkout for 3D Secure validation. This pop up will be provided by the bank that issued the card you are making payment with. If you have not already registered your card, you can use this pop up and follow the instructions to register securely. Once registered, you will be taken back to the Capstone website to complete your order. If you are at all concerned or confused, simply close the pop up window and complete your order as normal, then contact your bank to find out more about the schemes. Once registered, you will then be required to use your personal code on all subsequent online transactions.</p>  
   
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">All our credit card data is actually handled directly by Paypal and your issuing bank. Capstone at no time stores or even has access to your credit card details.  This is in line with PCI regulations and means your credit card security is preserved at all times.  </p>

		<h3>PayPal</h3>

<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">In order to be able to offer you PayPal’s payment options, we will pass to PayPal certain aspects of your personal information, such as contact and order details, in order for PayPal to assess whether you qualify for their payment options and to tailor the payment options for you.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">General information on PayPal you can find  here. Your personal data is handled in accordance with applicable data protection law and in accordance with the information in  PayPal’s privacy policy.</p>

     
		<h3>How we use your data </h3> 
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">Your personal details, including name, email address and contact addresses.</p>   
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">We use these to deliver your order to you, to keep you informed on its progress, for fraud prevention and detection, to personalise your web experience, and for customer services purposes. After an order with us, we may also perform market research in the form of a feedback questionnaire with our provider, Feefo. </p> 

 <p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">With your permission, we may also use this information to keep you up to date about our new products and services, in our referral scheme, or in other marketing messages. If you wish to stop receiving marketing messages, you can either unsubscribe using the link in every marketing email we send, or contact our customer services team.  </p>
   
		<h3>Your payment details   </h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">We keep a record of the billing address you supply to us as part of our fraud prevention work and for future customer service enquiries, such as to give a refund. If you have paid through a third party payment provider like Paypal, we will keep a record of your email address and the payment reference. For payments with a credit or debit card, we only store the last four digits of your card for fraud and customer service reasons. Because we use PayPal to process our payments, our system never actually even has access to your other card details. This is in line with PCI regulations and means your credit card security is preserved at all times.  </p>
   
		<h3>Your contact history   </h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">If you contact our customer services team by email or by phone, they may keep a record of this. This is useful for us to personalise the experience with you (so you don’t have to tell us the same things time and time again), to improve your experience, and to carry out staff training so that you can get the best possible service. We may also anonymise and aggregate information and use it to see patterns in our services so that we can improve.  </p>
   
		<h3>Your purchase history   </h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">This is important for us to provide good customer support and look after you in the event of any customer service enquiries. We may also use this to personalise your web experience and the emails we send you, and may also anonymise and aggregate the data to find out what products and services you and people like you might like. This helps us to improve our site and deliver a better experience for you. </p> 
   
		<h3>Information about your device and how you use our site  </h3> 
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">We may collect information about the devices you shop on, such as your mobile or browser. This not only helps us to improve our website for you, but also means we can get better at giving you a good experience by recognising your preferences and personalising the site for you. It may also be used in fraud prevention to recognise if, for example, a single device has been used with hundreds of different credit cards, allowing us to earmark suspicious behaviour and prevent other people’s cards from being used fraudulently.  
We may also collect information about how you move around our website, what you look at or search for, and how you shop. This may be anonymised to make improvements, or through the use of cookies, pixels, advert tags and other digital marketing technologies, may be used to create banners and ads relevant to you. These may be used on our own website or across the wider internet.  </p>
   
		<h3>Your data, your rights  </h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">As a responsible retailer, we want to keep you informed about how we use your information. You have a right to know this, and you should also be able to ask any retailer to detail it. In line with GDPR guidelines, you have a right to request details about the data we have on you, the right to request we correct any inaccurate personal information, the right to no longer receive direct marketing messages and the right to have some or all of your data forgotten or deleted. </p> 
   
<p align="justify" style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: small">If you have any questions about these rights, please contact our customer services team.</p>
